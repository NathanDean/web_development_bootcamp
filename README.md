# web_development_bootcamp
The first 7 weeks will cover what you need to know for basic web development. You will learn how to build accessible, responsive websites in HTML and CSS, as well as DOM manipulation and basic programming in JavaScript. 


Finally, you will learn how to interact with APIs.

The next weeks will cover coding principles, essential tools, and popular frameworks to take you to the next level of frontend Javascript development. At the end of the course a week is dedicated to answering any questions you have (and some you don't) on how to get your first job in the tech industry, along with practical preparation for taking tech tests.


Throughout the course there will be take-home tasks and exercise days, and two weeks dedicated to project builds
